# Perspective Assistant

Start with a drawing in one _or_ two point perspective.
Any time you need to split a trapezoid into multiple pieces (maybe you want to add five windows to the **side** of a building) tell this software where your end points are and it will tell you where to draw the new lines.

Or use this to extend a trapezoid.
Want to draw a road or train tracks going to the vanishing point?
Draw one stripe on a road, or one railroad tie.
Then tell this software where you drew that one piece.
The software will tell you where to draw the rest of your lines.
